# 📝 Daily Task Organizer

A simple Python program to help you plan, track, and review your daily tasks by categorizing them into completed and incomplete tasks.

---

## 📌 How It Works

1. **Create a checklist** of tasks at the beginning of the day.
2. At the **end of the day**, you review each task:
   - Mark tasks you completed.
   - Leave uncompleted tasks.
3. The program then **separates tasks** into:
   - ✅ Completed Tasks
   - ❌ Incomplete Tasks
4. Finally, it prints a summary of your productivity.
